**ArduinoCore-API emulator with C++ STL and boost library backing**

Emulation of the ArduinoCore-API for the host with as much backing by the Standard Template Library and boost as possible for cross-compatibility. 
The idea is to make things like communication libraries using code that compiles both on the Host and the Arduino side.

This project is inspired by both the [Arduino-Emulator](https://github.com/pschatzmann/Arduino-Emulator) project
sprinkled with ideas from ArduinoStreamUtils (https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoStreamUtils/tree/master/extras/test/cores/avr)
and the ArduinoCore-API test mocks.

## Do not use yet! This is my initial development fork
